# Melanoma Cancer Detection

An iOS application that uses a Machine learning model to detect the prediction of melanoma a user might have. With a simple embedded camera, I was able to process the captured frames to compare it with that stored in the predicted model that I developed. With an application like this, I believe we can allow patients from low-income families to diagnose themselves even if they cannot afford healthcare.

# Why do we Need This?
Around 200,000 people around the world suffer with melanoma skin cancer. However, the prominent issue is that these patients only find out that they have this disease after the situation gets worse.
<br / > Meet Melanoma Cancer Detection, an iOS application that allows users to detect if they are diagnosed with this disease simply with their smartphone.
If the application is able to detect melanoma in someone, they will be able to immediately visit a doctor.
 <br /> Step by step, we can all together prevent such high number of cases on melanoma reduce severely!

# How can I Improve?
If I incorporate React-Native with Javascript, I will be able to make this application cross-platform, allowing both iOS and Android users to utilize this application.
